Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- THe client is a fincancial consulting institution that provides financial plans for its clients. The company wanted to modernize its web application offerings.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
- I did well to include exception handling in my code. This was done when implementing the encryption algorithms. It did well to ensure that user data was protected. It is important code securley, as a client of this nature handles sensitive user data. Security is important to companies as it ensures that users can use their services without the worry of their data being in danger.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- The hardest part was configuring theMaven build process.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- I added encryption algorithms to further protect sensitive user information.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- I performed practices like static security analysis. This was done using the Maven dependency Check. It analyzed the code base for vulnerable dependencies that could compromise the application's security. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- I used testing methodologies like test-driven development. It shifted my focus to functionality.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- I would show them the final project report. It would display the code written and my personal methodology for this project.
